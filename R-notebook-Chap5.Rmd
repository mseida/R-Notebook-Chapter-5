This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
library("nycflights13")
library("tidyverse")

```

```{r}
nycflights13::flights
View(flights)
?flights
```

#int stands for integers.
#dbl stands for doubles, or real numbers.
#chr stands for character vectors, or strings.
#dttm stands for date-times (a date + a time).


```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```
  

If you want to determine if a value is missing, use is.na()  

filter() only includes rows where the condition is TRUE; it excludes both FALSE and NA values. If you want to preserve missing values, ask for them explicitly  
        - to ask explicitly, use comment notation to do this in parenthesis after              command



Exercises 5.2:

```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120) #10,200 flights

filter(flights, dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU") #9,313 flights

airlines 


filter(flights, carrier == "DL" | carrier == "AA" | carrier == "UA") #139,504 flights

filter(flights, month >= 7, month <= 9) #86,326 flights
  #with between fcn could do as 
  filter(flights, between(month, 7, 9))

summary(flights$dep_time)
filter(flights, dep_time <= 600 | dep_time == 2400) #9,373 flights

filter(flights, is.na(dep_time)) #8,255 flights


```

5.3
arrange() works similarly to filter() except that instead of selecting rows, it changes their order

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

Use desc() to re-order by a column in descending order and missing values are always sorted at the end

5.3 Exersices:

```{r}
arrange(flights, is.na(desc(dep_delay)))
arrange(flights, desc(is.na(dep_time)), dep_time)

arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay)) #longest to shortest
arrange(flights, dep_delay) #shortest to longest

arrange(flights, desc(distance)) #4983 miles
arrange(flights, distance) #17 miles


```

5.4
select() allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful subset using operations based on the names of the variables 

b/c some data sets have hundreds or thousands of variables and not all are necessary for analysis--use select to just look at and work with the ones that are

starts_with("abc"): matches names that begin with “abc”.
ends_with("xyz"): matches names that end with “xyz”.
contains("ijk"): matches names that contain “ijk”.

5.4 Exercises

```{r}
select(flights, "dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
select(flights, dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay)
select(flights, 4, 6, 7, 9) #this one uses column numbers of the variables
select(flights, starts_with("dep_"), starts_with("arr_"))

select(flights, year, month, day, year, year) #the select function does not count duplication and it only counts the vraiable once


```
5.5 
useful to add new columns that are functions of existing columns
, for this we can use mutate()

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
#If you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute()

#the function must be vectorised: it must take a vector of values as input, return a vector with the same number of values as output
```

5.5 Exercises
```{r}
air_time #I expect this to be the time of the flight in air 
arr_time - dep_time
```

5.6 
summarise () groups key data into a single row 
```{r}
summarise (flights)
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
summary(flights) # I prefer summary bc it gives you more data options to look at 
```
